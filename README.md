# Task App

A task app using a FastAPI backend and Svelte frontend. The project brief can be found [here](https://github.com/hmcts/dts-developer-challenge-junior).

## Getting Started

### Backend

A FastAPI server, serving endpoints conncted to a SQLite database. Uses pydantic models for data validation, and sqlalchemy as an ORM.

- This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) as a package manager, so install that if you don't have it.
- Then move into the backend directory and run `uv sync`.
- Copy `backend/.env.example` into `backend/.env`. The defualt values should be sufficient.
- `uv run fastapi dev app/main.py` will start the server.

### Frontend

A Svelte frontend.

- This project uses [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) so install that if you don't have it.
- Then move into the frontend directory and run `npm install`.
- Copy `frontend/.env.example` into `frontend/.env`. The defualt values should be sufficient.
- `npm run dev` will start the server.

## Testing

### Backend

Uses Pytest.

- Run the tests using `uv run pytest`.

### Frontend

Uses Vitest.

- Run the tests using `npx vitest`.

## Notes

- Database migrations are not currently implemented so a helper script can be run to delete the database if any changes need to be made. From the backend directory run `uv run app/delete_db.py`.
- FastAPI auto-generates api docs based on Pydantic code (`/backend/app/schemas.py`). Follow the 'docs' link logged in the terminal when you start the server.
- Much of the error handling on the backend is also handled by the Pydantic models defined in `backend/app/schemas.py`.

## Technical Requirements

Addressing the technical requirements outlined in the projcet brief:

- Backend: Any OOP language and framework of your choice: **Python and FastAPI**.
- Frontend: Any language and framework of your choice: **HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Svelte**.
- Implement unit tests: **Pytest and Vitest**
- Store data in a database: **SQLite database via sqlalchemy**
- Include validation and error handling: **Pydantic and Error Handling**
- Document API endpoints: **auto-generated by FastAPI**
